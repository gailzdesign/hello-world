# interactive data viz 

I'm an Information Designer and a mom..and a wife. I like data visualization. A lot. I first learned about data visualization while working at The Wall Street Journal. I liked working there. I liked the people. Then, after 6 years, I went to work for a Consulting Agency as an Information Designer. This was great because I was eventually able to marry my love of data visualization with my love of design and illustration. And now, I want to make interactive data visualizations. A lot. But I am new to the coding world. I have a lot to learn. A lot.
